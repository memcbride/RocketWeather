#  Rocket Weather
#### Under Development

I first completed the wonderful series by Stewart Lynch ( https://www.youtube.com/@StewartLynch ) on developing a MyWeather app.

I'm using that code as a basis for developing a the Rocket Weather App.

The main design goals for the app are:
- Allow me to set and persist a set of model rocket launch sites.
- Allow me to set and persist a set of model rockets.
- Allow me to take a snapshot of very specialized weather information immediately before launching a given model rocket.
- Allow me to save the weather information with the model rocket launch information to a JSON file for processing in other app.
